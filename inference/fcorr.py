r'''
A mis-alignment indicator metric.

Example usages:
    Comparing single pair of 8x8 images:
      f1,p1 = get_fft_power2(torch.tensor(x[0, :8, :8]))  # 8x8 block in slice 0
      f2,p2 = get_fft_power2(torch.tensor(x[1, :8, :8]))  # 8x8 block in slice 1
      return get_hp_fcorr(f1, p1, f2, p2)
    
    Comparing every pair of adjacent 8x8 slices in a Dx8x8 stack:
      f,p = get_fft_power2(x)  # x is Dx8x8 block as a torch tensor
      rho = get_hp_fcorr(f[:-1,:,:,:], p[:-1,:,:], f[1:,:,:,:], p[1:,:,:])  # 1 slice short
